# Air Pollution (India)

In the recent years, there has been a rising concern regarding its rising air pollution levels. Hence we will be using . The dataset that we are using for our analysis depicts state-wise data with respect to air pollutants such as SO2 (Sulphur Dioxide), NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide), Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM), Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) and Particulate Matter (PM 2.5). The records range from the year 1990 all the way up to 2005.


# Dataset

The data set can be downloaded via kaggle: ("https://www.kaggle.com/shrutibhargava94/india-air-quality-data")

Upon downloading the dataset, we created python notebook for our further analysis.


# Procedures

In order to conduct our analysis we followed the following steps:
I. Acquiring/Downloading the Dataset
II. Uploading/Ingestion of the Dataset
III. Importing the Necessary Packages (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, SimpleImputer)
IV. Reading the Dataset
V. Data Cleaning
VI. Handling Missing Values
VII. Statewise Grouping of SO2, NO2, RSPM, SPM values (Includes Graphs)
VIII. Trend Analysis of SO2, NO2, RSPM, SPM in the State of Andhra Pradesh (Includes Graphs)
IX. Observations and Findings
